Description:  Functions for drawing node-and-edge graphs that have been 
              laid out by graphviz.  This provides an alternative 
              rendering to that provided by the 'Rgraphviz' package, with
              two main advantages:  the rendering provided by 'gridGraphviz'
              should be more similar to what 'graphviz' itself would draw;
              and rendering with 'grid' allows for post-hoc customisations
              using the named viewports and grobs that 'gridGraphviz'
              produces.
